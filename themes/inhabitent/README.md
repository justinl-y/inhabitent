# Inhabitent Website - WordPress, PHP, SASS / CSS, JQuery

This project was intended to demonstrate the use of WordPress and PHP to create a content 
management system driven website.

The focus of the project was the creation and implementation of a custom theme for WordPress 
conforming to a design specification.

##Technologies Used

- WordPress
- PHP
- HTML5
- CSS3/SASS
- JavaScript
- JQuery
- GULP

##Personal Learnings

This project allowed me to explore the use of WordPress to create a content management system 
website with a user accessible back end UI.  Required functionality necessitated investigation
 and use of the WordPress template hierarchy for appropriate archive and other page types.

Use was made of plugins for third party functionality as well as development of custom widgets
and post types for various data components.

This project made heavy use of CSS and SASS for presentational styling. The design specification required particular attention to be made to flexbox for positioning.

GULP was used to add developer functionality for task automation in the creation of minified JS and CSS files.
